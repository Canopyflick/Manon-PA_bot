Ben says: Warum besonders f√ºr mich?
- Habe nicht das richtige studiert. Bin dann in mein Berufsleben immer weiter in die Richtung vom technischen Bereich gewachsen:
 - Angefangen als Editor, beim medizinischer E-learningfirma. Langsam mehr Produktmanagementsachen gemacht, bis ich im PDM-Team war.
 - Dann kam ChatGPT, ich war sehr begeisters beizutragen zum KI-gestutzte Inhaltserstellung, habe ich teilweise auch KI-Pipelines designed 
 - Vertrag nicht verl√§ngert, weil die Firma sich organisatorisch anders gestalten wollte (Aufl√∂sung des PDM-Teams, off-shoring in die Phillipines)
  - Mache aber immer noch 1-2 Tage die Woche nebent√§tig f√ºr sie weite, gerade das meist Technische Teil von meiner T√§tigkeiten: KI-Pipelinedesign
  - Das Ding is nur dass ich nur zur gewissen Ma√üe die Technische skills habe die man daf√ºr braucht. Ich denke mir das aus, probiere ein bisschen rum, aber muss immer sehr eng mit den Developern zusammenarbeiten um sie das tats√§chlich bauen zu lassen. Es w√ºrde viel effizienter sein wenn ich das selber machen k√∂nnte. Es ist eigentlich sehr Unique wie ich mit meine geringen F√§higkeiten jetzt schon quasi-Technisch besch√§ftigt bin.
  - Was ich gerade mache, genau so das weniger technische Teil von KI-pipeline design, ist nie als Job anderswo gefragt.

Eg: weekly, every Monday before 17:00, every now and then, custom (for irregular intervals), etc.. \n        ## deadlines: at what moments should the goal be evaluated?\n        Pick a maximum of 30 options in the future. It is fine to schedule for future years if that\'s in line with the user\'s stated intention. Unless specified otherwise, schedule deadlines end of day 23:55.\n        ## schedule_reminder: bool\n        Only schedule reminders for goals where it would be helpful to the user to be reminded of the goal on days other than the days of the deadlines. Ie: not for daily goals, but goals that probably span multiple days, or don\'t have a particular day on which the user needs to work on them. So, only schedule reminders for goals where it might be helpful to the user to work on the goal on days other than the deadline days.\n        ## reminder_time\n        Pick (a) useful moment(s) to remind the user about this goal, depending on the specific goal. For goals requiring regular effort and spanning longer time periods, somewhere 60-80% towards the deadlines are good moments for a reminder. But reminder timing depends strongly on the specific goal and timeline.\n        \n        ## time_investment_value: what kind of time-investment does each individual occurence of the goal take? This will serve as the goal\'s Base Value.\n        Pick a number between 1 and 50 for the time_investment_value. Some values with examples for reference:\n        1 = something that takes less than a minute\n        2 = something that takes less than 15 minutes\n        3 = something that takes about half an hour\n        4 = something that takes about 45 minutes\n        5 = something that takes about an hour\n        6 = timespan of 2 hours\n        7 = timespan of 3-4 hours\n        8 = timespan of 4-5 hours\n        9 = timespan of 5-6 hours\n        10 = timespan of a full day\n        15 = timespan of a few days\n        20 = timespan of a week\n        25 = timespan of a few weeks\n        30 = timespan of a month\n        35 = timespan of 2 months\n        40 = timespan of a quarter\n        50 = timespan of half a year\n        60 = timespan of a year or more\n \n        ## effort_multiplier: how hard is each individual occurence of the goal likely to be? Think only about the level of friction that is to overcome, to do with the required concentration and level of enjoyment/suffering while doing it.\n        Pick any number between 0.1 and 2 for the effort_multiplier. Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.1 = a fun goal that is really entirely more like a reward (eating cookies) \n        0.2 = fun, but some exertion is required that might not be fun (plan a nice date)\n        0.75 = slightly below average effort\n        1 = average effort (for standard \'useful\' tasks: continuous normal focused work, meditation, exercise, administration tasks)\n        1.25 = slightly above average effort\n        1.5 = above-average effort and friction (job hunting, scary and/or difficult task, maybe somewhat outside of comfort zone)\n        1.75 = slightly below maximum effort\n        2 = maximum effort. Non-stop non-fun high-stress activity (giving a presentation, interviewing, doing something that makes the user feel quite scared/stressed/vulnerable)\n        \n        ## impact_multiplier: to what degree does each individual occurence of this goal advance the user\'s long-term goals (or help the people around them)?\n        Pick a number between 0.5 and 1.5. Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.5 = not so useful/impactful in the long-term\n        1 = advances their long-term well-being and goals at a normal, sufficient rate \n        1.5 = especially impactful, probably maximizes their time (from future Ben\'s perspective).\n        Please note that all the reference values given are just that: references for inspiration. They are only examples of some fixed points on a scale that is in fact gradual/continuous.

It is currently: 2024-12-04 23:24:08.474427+01:00\n        Please judge Ben\'s goal setting intention of a recurring goal, and fill the following fields: \n            # Prepare and send OpenAI messages\n            class RecurringGoalSetData(BaseModel):\n                reasoning: str\n                interval: str\n                deadline: List[str]  \n                schedule_reminder: bool\n                  reminder_time: Union[List[str], None] = Field(\n                    default=None,\n                    description="A list of one or more timestamps for reminders in ISO 8601 format, or null if no reminders should be scheduled."\n                )\n                time_investment_value: float\n                effort_multiplier: float\n                impact_multiplier: float\n            \n            messages = await prepare_openai_messages(\n                update, \n                user_message, \n                message_type=\'recurring_goal_set_data\'\n            )\n            \n        ## reasoning: time to think\n        Take a few preparatory sentences to reflect on fitting values for the other fields. Focus on the ones that you\'re unsure about and therefor require consideration. \n        ## interval\n        Describe the interval between the deadlines, as completely as possible, insofar as the user themselves specified this. Eg: weekly, every Monday before 17:00, every now and then, custom (for irregular intervals), etc.. \n        ## deadlines: at what moments should the goal be evaluated?\n        Pick a maximum of 30 options in the future. It is fine to schedule for future years if that\'s in line with the user\'s stated intention. Unless specified otherwise, schedule deadlines end of day 23:55.\n        ## schedule_reminder: bool\n        Only schedule reminders for goals where it would be helpful to the user to be reminded of the goal on days other than the days of the deadlines. Ie: not for daily goals, but goals that probably span multiple days, or don\'t have a particular day on which the user needs to work on them. So, only schedule reminders for goals where it might be helpful to the user to work on the goal on days other than the deadline days.\n        ## reminder_time\n        Pick (a) useful moment(s) to remind the user about this goal, depending on the specific goal. For goals requiring regular effort and spanning longer time periods, somewhere 60-80% towards the deadlines are good moments for a reminder. But reminder timing depends strongly on the specific goal and timeline.\n        \n        ## time_investment_value: what kind of time-investment does each individual occurence of the goal take? This will serve as the goal\'s Base Value.\n        Pick a number between 1 and 50 for the time_investment_value. Some values with examples for reference:\n        1 = something that takes less than a minute\n        2 = something that takes less than 15 minutes\n        3 = something that takes about half an hour\n        4 = something that takes about 45 minutes\n        5 = something that takes about an hour\n        6 = timespan of 2 hours\n        7 = timespan of 3-4 hours\n        8 = timespan of 4-5 hours\n        9 = timespan of 5-6 hours\n        10 = timespan of a full day\n        15 = timespan of a few days\n        20 = timespan of a week\n        25 = timespan of a few weeks\n        30 = timespan of a month\n        35 = timespan of 2 months\n        40 = timespan of a quarter\n        50 = timespan of half a year\n        60 = timespan of a year or more\n \n        ## effort_multiplier: how hard is each individual occurence of the goal likely to be? Think only about the level of friction that is to overcome, to do with the required concentration and level of enjoyment/suffering while doing it.\n        Pick any number between 0.1 and 2 for the effort_multiplier. Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.1 = a fun goal that is really entirely more like a reward (eating cookies) \n        0.2 = fun, but some exertion is required that might not be fun (plan a nice date)\n        0.75 = slightly below average effort\n        1 = average effort (for standard \'useful\' tasks: continuous normal focused work, meditation, exercise, administration tasks)\n        1.25 = slightly above average effort\n        1.5 = above-average effort and friction (job hunting, scary and/or difficult task, maybe somewhat outside of comfort zone)\n        1.75 = slightly below maximum effort\n        2 = maximum effort. Non-stop non-fun high-stress activity (giving a presentation, interviewing, doing something that makes the user feel quite scared/stressed/vulnerable)\n        \n        ## impact_multiplier: to what degree does each individual occurence of this goal advance the user\'s long-term goals (or help the people around them)?\n        Pick a number between 0.5 and 1.5. Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.5 = not so useful/impactful in the long-term\n        1 = advances their long-term well-being and goals at a normal, sufficient rate \n        1.5 = especially impactful, probably maximizes their time (from future Ben\'s perspective).\n        Please note that all the reference values given are just that: references for inspiration. They are only examples of some fixed points on a scale that is in fact gradual/continuous. It is your task to pick the exact numbers you deem most apt for each specific case.\n        \nBen\'s stated personal long term goals are: \'<coroutine object fetch_long_term_goals at 0x00000155B09E5FC0>\''}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "# The message of the user\nBen says: I will finish my thesis' first chapter end of this week, and the second one two weeks later, and the third one two weeks after that"}]

Focus on the ones that you\'re unsure about and therefor require consideration. \n        ## interval\n        Describe the interval between the deadlines, as completely as possible, insofar as the user themselves specified this. Eg: weekly, every Monday before 17:00, every now and then, custom (for irregular intervals), etc.. \n        ## deadlines: at what moments should the goal be evaluated?\n        Pick a maximum of 30 options in the future. It is fine to schedule for future years if that\'s in line with the user\'s stated intention. Unless specified otherwise, schedule deadlines end of day 23:55.\n        ## schedule_reminder: bool\n        Only schedule reminders for goals where it would be helpful to the user to be reminded of the goal on days other than the days of the deadlines. Ie: not for daily goals, but goals that probably span multiple days, or don\'t have a particular day on which the user needs to work on them. So, only schedule reminders for goals where it might be helpful to the user to work on the goal on days other than the deadline days.\n        ## reminder_time\n        Pick (a) useful moment(s) to remind the user about this goal, depending on the specific goal. For goals requiring regular effort and spanning longer time periods, somewhere 60-80% towards the deadlines are good moments for a reminder. But reminder timing depends strongly on the specific goal and timeline. Unless specified otherwise, schedule reminders at 11:11.\n        \n        ## time_investment_value: what kind of time-investment does each individual occurence of the goal take? This will serve as the goal\'s Base Value.\n        Pick a number between 1 and 50 for the time_investment_value. Some values with examples for reference:\n        1 = something that takes less than a minute\n        2 = something that takes less than 15 minutes\n        3 = something that takes about half an hour\n        4 = something that takes about 45 minutes\n        5 = something that takes about an hour\n        6 = timespan of 2 hours\n        7 = timespan of 3-4 hours\n        8 = timespan of 4-5 hours\n        9 = timespan of 5-6 hours\n        10 = timespan of a full day\n        15 = timespan of a few days\n        20 = timespan of a week\n        25 = timespan of a few weeks\n        30 = timespan of a month\n        35 = timespan of 2 months\n        40 = timespan of a quarter\n        50 = timespan of half a year\n        60 = timespan of a year or more\n \n        ## effort_multiplier: how hard is each individual occurence of the goal likely to be? Think only about the level of friction that is to overcome, to do with the required concentration and level of enjoyment/suffering while doing it.\n        Pick any number between 0.1 and 2 for the effort_multiplier. Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.1 = a fun goal that is really entirely more like a reward (eating cookies) \n        0.2 = fun, but some exertion is required that might not be fun (plan a nice date)\n        0.75 = slightly below average effort\n        1 = average effort (for standard \'useful\' tasks: continuous normal focused work, meditation, exercise, administration tasks)\n        1.25 = slightly above average effort\n        1.5 = above-average effort and friction (job hunting, scary and/or difficult task, maybe somewhat outside of comfort zone)\n        1.75 = slightly below maximum effort\n        2 = maximum effort. Non-stop non-fun high-stress activity (giving a presentation, interviewing, doing something that makes the user feel quite scared/stressed/vulnerable)\n        \n        ## impact_multiplier: to what degree does each individual occurence of this goal advance the user\'s long-term goals (or help the people around them)?\n        Pick a number between 0.5 and 1.5. Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.5 = not so useful/impactful in the long-term\n        1 = advances their long-term well-being and goals at a normal, sufficient rate \n        1.5 = especially impactful, probably maximizes their time (from future Ben\'s perspective).\n        Please note that all the reference values given are just that: references for inspiration. They are only examples of some fixed points on a scale that is in fact gradual/continuous. It is your task to pick the exact numbers you deem most apt for each specific case.\n        \nBen\'s stated personal long term goals are: \'<coroutine object fetch_long_term_goals at 0x000002D55632C580>\''}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '# The message of the user\nBen says: For the next 15 days, I want to meditate every morning'}]

Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.5 = not so useful/impactful in the long-term\n        1 = advances their long-term well-being and goals at a normal, sufficient rate \n        1.5 = especially impactful, probably maximizes their time (from future Ben\'s perspective).\n        Please note that all the reference values given are just that: references for inspiration.

Eg: weekly, every Monday before 17:00, every now and then, custom (for irregular intervals), etc.. \n        ## deadlines: at what moments should the goal be evaluated?\n        Pick a maximum of 30 options in the future. It is fine to schedule for future years if that\'s in line with the user\'s stated intention.

Ie: not for daily goals, but goals that probably span multiple days, or don\'t have a particular day on which the user needs to work on them. So, only schedule reminders for goals where it might be helpful to the user to work on the goal on days other than the deadline days.\n        ## reminder_time\n        Pick (a) useful moment(s) to remind the user about this goal, depending on the specific goal. For goals requiring regular effort and spanning longer time periods, a few days before each deadline are good moments for a reminder.

Think only about the level of friction that is to overcome, to do with the required concentration and level of enjoyment/suffering while doing it.\n        Pick any number between 0.1 and 2 for the effort_multiplier. Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.1 = a fun goal that is really entirely more like a reward (eating cookies) \n        0.2 = fun, but some exertion is required that might not be fun (plan a nice date)\n        0.75 = slightly below average effort\n        1 = average effort (for standard \'useful\' tasks: continuous normal focused work, meditation, exercise, administration tasks)\n        1.25 = slightly above average effort\n        1.5 = above-average effort and friction (job hunting, scary and/or difficult task, maybe somewhat outside of comfort zone)\n        1.75 = slightly below maximum effort\n        2 = maximum effort. Non-stop non-fun high-stress activity (giving a presentation, interviewing, doing something that makes the user feel quite scared/stressed/vulnerable)\n        \n        ## impact_multiplier: to what degree does each individual occurence of this goal advance the user\'s long-term goals (or help the people around them)?\n        Pick a number between 0.5 and 1.5. Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.5 = not so useful/impactful in the long-term\n        1 = advances their long-term well-being and goals at a normal, sufficient rate \n        1.5 = especially impactful, probably maximizes their time (from future Ben\'s perspective).\n        Please note that all the reference values given are just that: references for inspiration.

Non-stop non-fun high-stress activity (giving a presentation, interviewing, doing something that makes the user feel quite scared/stressed/vulnerable)\n        \n        ## impact_multiplier: to what degree does each individual occurence of this goal advance the user\'s long-term goals (or help the people around them)?\n        Pick a number between 0.5 and 1.5. Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.5 = not so useful/impactful in the long-term\n        1 = advances their long-term well-being and goals at a normal, sufficient rate \n        1.5 = especially impactful, probably maximizes their time (from future Ben\'s perspective).\n        Please note that all the reference values given are just that: references for inspiration.

Non-stop non-fun high-stress activity (giving a presentation, interviewing, doing something that makes the user feel quite scared/stressed/vulnerable)\n        \n        ## impact_multiplier: to what degree does this advance the user\'s long-term goals (or help the people around them)?\n        Pick a number between 0.5 and 1.5. Some values with examples for reference:\n        0.5 = not so useful/impactful in the long-term\n        1 = advances their long-term well-being and goals at a normal, sufficient rate \n        1.5 = especially impactful, probably maximizes their time (from future Ben\'s perspective).\n        Please note that all the reference values given are just that: references for inspiration. They are only examples of some fixed points on a scale that is in fact gradual/continuous. It is your task to pick the exact numbers you deem most apt for each specific case.\n        \nBen\'s stated personal long term goals are: \'<coroutine object fetch_long_term_goals at 0x0000017367615480>\''}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '# The message of the user\nBen says: I want to be challenged to do something outside of my comfort zone some specific day in 2025'}]
